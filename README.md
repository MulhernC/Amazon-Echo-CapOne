### Description
This project is a capstone project for CMPSC 483W that is sponsored by Capital One. The project will utilize the Amazon Echo to perform bank related actions.


In today’s world more and more technology is created to simplify our lives. No longer do we have to wait on a landline to call someone or turn to a bulky computer to check email. We no longer have to walk to a brick and mortar banks to make transactions. Now everything is at our fingertips, we can do all of these things from our cell phones. But what if we didn’t even have to type on our phones to make a transaction? What if we could speak and tell our bank what we wanted to do at any hour of the day? The Amazon Echo provides the capabilities for this to become a reality. The Amazon Echo is voice controlled and allows the user to perform a variety of tasks. A user can set alarms, play music, and various other actions. Capital One wants to experiment with this new technology and see what capabilities are possible for the banking industry.  Capital One would like us to make use of the Amazon Echo technology to drive innovation. Our role is to create a proof of concept that banking transactions can be conducted in this manner.
